Welcome to the Flutter Plants E-Commerce project! In this project, you will create a visually appealing user interface for a plants e-commerce application using Flutter. You'll apply various concepts including dealing with JSON data, creating models, retrieving information, using packages, implementing CRUD functionality, and following clean code principles.

## Requirements

1. **UI Implementation:**
    - Implement the user interface based on the provided Figma design for a plants e-commerce application.
    - Utilize custom widgets for code reusability and maintainability.

2. **JSON Data Handling:**
    - Retrieve plant data from a JSON file.
    - Create models to represent plant objects and map JSON data to Dart objects.
    - Display plant information including images, names, prices, and descriptions, etc.

3. **Package Integration:**
    - Utilize 2-3 animation packages or related Flutter libraries for enhanced user experience.
    - Use shared_preferences or get_storage packages for local data persistence.
    - Implement dependency injection with the Get_it package.

4. **CRUD Functionality:**
    - Allow users to add plants to favorites or saved list, update quantities in the shopping cart, view plant details, and manage the cart items (Deleting or saved plant for later).
    - Ensure seamless CRUD operations reflecting changes in UI and data models.

5. **Filtering functionality:** 
    - Add filtering function by allowing the user to display all indoor or outdoor plants.
